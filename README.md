## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Less custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Less](https://lesscss.org/) - CSS preprocessor
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

This project didn't teach me a lot of stuff as i used it to put more practice on some things that i used in the past weeks, like bootstrap and making landing pages. Beside that and in an unexpected way, i learned about the picture tag which was really helpful to swap between images depending on the size of the device.


### Continued development
Would love to use bootstrap again or maybe try another CSS framework like tailwind.
